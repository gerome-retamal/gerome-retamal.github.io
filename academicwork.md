Hi there! Here are my academic outputs.

# Thesis
* Effect of carbon tariffs on emissions and trade with heterogenous sectoral elasticities: The case of EU-China

This study aggregated trade data to match with available emissions data, and then used the same to run a poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood regression, of a gravity model of trade specification.

* [Role of virtual water in Taiwan: A multiregional input-output analysis (台灣虛擬水貿易的角色: 多區域投入產出分析)](https://tdr.lib.ntu.edu.tw/jspui/handle/123456789/85389)

This study used input-output tables and to identify virtual water importer and exporters.

* [Benefit-cost analysis of using alternative types of air conditioning units in the University of the Philippines Los Baños](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340443640_A_Benefit-Cost_Analysis_of_Using_Alternative_Types_of_Air_Conditioning_Units_in_the_University_of_the_Philippines_Los_Banos)


This study used primary data on types and usage of air conditioning units (ACU) in the university. Electricity costs and emissions costs savings (arising from use of non-banned refrigerant) were estimated to find net present values of a hypothetical university-wide ACU replacement.
