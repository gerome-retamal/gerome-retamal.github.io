title: "About me"
---
Hi there! You may call me Gerome. I made this blog to share my thoughts that I would most likely not be able to say in person, mainly because I am an introvert (at least I consider myself to be). I have a background in economics, and interests in trade, agriculture, and environment, so most of the things that you'll find here are about those topics. I like tinkering with data, either making figures out of it through Excel, or playing with it (meaning finding summary statistics, running regressions) through R or Stata.

On a less serious note, I like playing badminton. I'm not an expert, and I don't think I am an intermediate either, most likely I'm an advanced beginner. I also like watching legal, political, and medical dramas. Have you watched Suits, Madam Secretary, or Grey's Anatomy?

I have lived (defined as staying for at least 5 months) in the Philippines, Taiwan, Belgium, South Africa, Italy, and Switzerland, mainly for studies but also for work. I speak English, Filipino, and an A2-B1 level of Mandarin Chinese. I am trying (but most of the time failing) to self-study French, which I would dare say, is more difficult to learn than Mandarin Chinese.

Well, that's me. Want to know more? (Or want to hire me?) See below or my CV, up there!
